# coffee_vs_livercancer

## Project Overview

This project involves the analysis of various datasets related to coffee consumption, GDP, healthcare indices, and liver cancer incidence across different countries. The goal is to gain insights into potential relationships between these factors and to explore any interesting trends or patterns that may emerge from the data.

### Files

- `coffee_consumption.csv`: Contains data on coffee consumption (in pounds per person per year) for different countries.
- `country_by_gdp.csv`: Contains data on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for different countries. *Note: This file is included but not used in the current analysis.*
- `country_by_health_care_index.csv`: Contains data on healthcare indices for different countries. *Note: This file is included but not used in the current analysis.*
- `liver_cancer_incidence.csv`: Contains data on liver cancer incidence rates for different countries.
- `insights.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and insights derived from the data.
- `merged_data.csv`: CSV file containing the merged data from the different datasets.
- `scrape_merging.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing code for scraping and merging the datasets.

### Data Sources

The data used in this project was obtained from the following sources:

- Coffee Consumption: [worldatlas][(https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/top-10-coffee-consuming-nations.html)]
- GDP: [worldpopulationreview][https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/by-gdp]
- Healthcare Indices: [numbeo][https://www.numbeo.com/health-care/rankings_by_country.jsp]
- Liver Cancer Incidence: [worldlifeexpectancy][https://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/cause-of-death/liver-cancer/by-country/]

Citations and references for each dataset will be provided within the notebook.

### Insights

The insights.ipynb notebook contains detailed analysis and visualizations exploring various aspects of the data. Key insights and findings will be documented here.

### Data Sources

The data used in this project was obtained from reputable sources such as government agencies, international organizations, and research institutions. Citations and references for each dataset will be provided within the notebook.

### Future Work

The `country_by_gdp.csv` and `country_by_health_care_index.csv` files are included in the project but are not used in the current analysis. They can be explored in future iterations of the project to further investigate their relationships with coffee consumption and liver cancer incidence.

### Usage

To replicate the analysis or explore the data further, you can refer to the insights.ipynb notebook. Ensure that you have the necessary Python libraries installed to run the code.
